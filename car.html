        <h1>Cars</h1>
        <p>
            <span id="firstWord">Cars</span> have always been something I've been fond of. Ever since my dad bought his first car, my admiration for them has only grown. Some people prefer to sit back and enjoy the ride—relaxing in the backseat or simply watching the scenery.

            While I enjoy those moments too, one thing I love is watching my dad drive and being intrigued by the mechanics of how cars work. I also spend time observing other cars on the road while we travel, which is a fun way to pass the time.

            Today, 99% of the time, I can identify the name and brand of a car at just a glance—whether it’s from the design of the body or even the way the headlights project at night.

            One of my favorite hobbies is visiting car dealership websites, scrolling through different cars, adding accessories, and reaching the summary page—only to start the process all over again.
